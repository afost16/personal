                        <p>Pain Point is a mobile app platform designed to empower college students to voice their
                            concerns about the built environment on a university campus setting. Students can voice
                            their concerns by creating their own posts, or increase the general awareness of an issue by
                            signing on other users&rsquo; posts.</p>

                        <p>With both potential interactions, Pain Point&rsquo;s goal is to amass signatures of specific
                            issues to in order to recognize and value the opinion&rsquo;s of students.</p>

                <h2>How it started</h2>
                <p>During one of the first lectures of my Interaction Design Thinking class, my professor prompted a
                    discussion
                    about an infamous crosswalk in the heart of Indiana University&rsquo;s campus and the different
                    factors
                    contributing to the problem. I left this fun, in-depth discussion with a real passion to not only
                    delve further
                    into
                    topics discussed in class, but to seek a greater understanding in transportation and
                    traffic on
                    IU&rsquo;s campus.</p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>Approach</h2>
                <p>Based on the class discussion, our team sought to learn how students perceive
                    transportation
                    issues and envisage potential solutions. To achieve this goal, we conducted interviews on busy
                    sidewalks of IU&rsquo;s campus to gather
                    instant
                    feedback
                    from real participants. Additional participants were recruited through surveys
                    which
                    later
                    were compared with the responses from the interviews.</p>

                <p>A foundational survey was conducted, with a second iteration being a modified and adjusted survey
                    designed to target insights identified in the initial one. In total, my team gathered 123
                    responses, with at least 87 being distinct
                    responses
                    from the survey as there was a modified second version of the survey. Only three in-person
                    interviews on
                    the
                    sidewalks were conducted, and in retrospect, I believe that having additional interviews would have
                    diversified the collected data.</p>
            </section>

                <h2>Insights</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>Students are passionate about transportations issues and hold many opinions on what reform may
                        look
                        like
                    </li>
                    <li>Students don&rsquo;t think that change is possible for the issues they experience because they
                        are
                        too
                        broad
                        and ambiguous for a one-to-one solution</li>
                    <p>“I mean yeah I would like all transportation issues fixed but it's IU baby, let's be serious.”
                    </p>
                    <p>“I&rsquo;m not sure there&rsquo;s anything anyone can do about it.”</p>
                    <li>Because there are so many problem areas within transportation, students feel like an effort to
                        change
                        them will be inconsequential to their daily lives</li>
                </ol>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
                <p>Students need a more effective method to passionately voice their concerns to make them believe
                    change
                    is
                    possible for the built environment.</p>

            <section>
                <h2>How Might We?</h2>
                <p>Based on the insights from primary research, I facilitated a brainstorming activity by creating
                    questions
                    that may generate possible solutions:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>How might we make students feel that their opinions are being heard?</li>
                    <li>How might we make students feel that change is possible?</li>
                    <li>How might we increase communication and awareness of unknown issues faced by other students?
                    </li>
                </ol>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>Design Process</h2>
                <p> To begin the design process, concepts were formed based on the “How Might We” questions in the form
                    of
                    an
                    iterative design brainstorming activity. Subsequently, the concepts were evaluated on the framework
                    of
                    if
                    they are <b>desirable</b>, <b>feasible</b>, and <b>viable</b>, leading to a concept.</p>

                <h2>Initial Brainstorming</h2>
                <p><b>Reporting Platform Concept</b></p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Pointing out an issue- Users can select different parts of physical architecture on a map that
                        cause
                        problems on campus.</li>
                    <li>Reacting to an issue- Users can react to a certain problem identified by someone else in an
                        attempt
                        to
                        gain consensus.</li>
                    <li>Feature for multiple points to be selected- There is an additional option to select multiple
                        pain
                        points
                        if it involves more than one piece of physical architecture.</li>

                <h2>Design Inspiration</h2>
                <p>To get a better sense of the type of communication that would be most impactful for users,
                    inspiration
                    was
                    taken from change.org, which uses a petitioning system that allows for users to create their own
                    petitions
                    and also sign on other petition posts. As a small iteration, a design change was made to allow users
                    to
                    sign
                    on other posts instead of reacting as it better aligned with answering the research goal: <b>How
                        might
                        we
                        increase communication and awareness of unknown issues faced by other students?</b>

            <section>
                <h2>Experience Prototyping</h2>
                <p>Based on the main experiences of making a post and reacting to a post, it was decided that in order
                    to
                    truly
                    understand how a student would interact with the concept, it would need to be put in real world
                    context.
                </p>

                <p>To best simulate this experience, a prototype in the form of a clipboard was created. Participants
                    were
                    tasked to write any issues that they found relevant that they would like to make a post about. If a
                    participant saw another post on this page that they agree with, they can tally next to that post.
                </p>

                <p> Trying to give participants the freedom to simulate a realistic use case proved difficult, so the
                    participants were given the freedom to go wherever they wanted for as long as they wanted.</p>

                    <li>Signing/Tallying</li>
                    <p>Are users likely to sign off or tally other users&rsquo; posts? In what order do interactions
                        occur
                        and in
                        what
                        steps do they take?</p>

                <h2>Insights from Experience Prototyping</h2>
                <p>After conducting prototyping experiences from 4 participants, there were many insights gathered, and
                    some
                    that had not been considered at all. In hindsight, there should have been more deliberation for what
                    needs
                    to be answered from the prototyping experience.
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Users acknowledge issues that may not affect them personally but tend not to take any more
                        action.
                    </li>
                    <li>Users are drawn to titles and tally posts without looking into more detail with the rest of the
                        information.</li>
                    <li>When making a post, users would be confused with how to fit aspects of the pain point into given
                        labels.
                    </li>
                    <li>Visuals are crucial in making sure users know where pain points are from other users.</li>

                    <li>The current commenting method is not intuitive</li>
                    <p>Opportunity for improvement- Make it clearer that users need to sign a post before posting a
                        comment
                    </p>

                    <li>The meaning of signing a post in unclear</li>
                    <p>Opportunity for improvement- Create an informative onboarding process to give first time users a
                        better
                        idea
                        of what the different features are</p>

                    <li>There was some confusion about whether they could fill out information</li>
                    <p>Opportunity for improvement- Clearly outline the fidelity of the prototype or increase the
                        functionality
                        of
                        filling out information</p>

            <section>

                <ol>
                    <li>Establishing Goals</li>
                    <p>Outlining the goal of methods in the design process is imperative in creating user-centered
                        designs.
                        Ultimately, the goal of the method isn&rsquo;t just about doing the method for the sake of doing
                        it,
                        but
                        actually about gathering insights that fill gaps in your understanding of the user group and
                        their
                        problems. Additionally, the information that is gathered from these methods is meant to be
                        critically
                        analyzed. In hindsight, if more time were spent trying to understand why people answered or
                        performed
                        tasks a certain way, a more satisfying final product would have been produced.
                    </p>

                    <li>Communicating with Group Members</li>
                    <p>I also learned the importance of valuing others' opinions in a group setting. As a designer,
                        it&rsquo;s
                        commonly understood that listening to and collecting insights from users is necessary in the
                        design
                        process. What I grossly underestimated, though, is that sometimes groups also require similar
                        communication. While many times I struggled with articulating ideas with my group when
                        facilitating
                        conversation, the miscommunication that sometimes transpired allowed for my group to provide
                        unique
                        ideas or change my approach in reaching common ground. If others in my group are struggling to
                        understand a concept or function, it is increasingly likely that the same can be said about real
                        users, making it all the more imperative that I am clear in my communication.

                <p>For future design-related projects, outlining the goals of a method should be the first step before
                    performing the method. Asking myself and my team a question like “what are the insights that we are
                    planning
                    to get out of using this method?” will be conducive to a better understanding of a user
                    group&rsquo;s
                    problem
                    space.
