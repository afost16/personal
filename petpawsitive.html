        <h3>Problem Statement</h3>
        <p>How can we create a cleaner and safer home environment for college students with pets at the same time
            increase the rate of adoption at shelters?</p>

        <h3>Scenario Focus</h3>
        <p>While there are many preexisting technologies to help clean the home, our research proved that educating
            younger people with the reality of taking care of a pet is a space within our problem that can be
            significantly improved.</p>

        <h3>Discovery</h3>
        <p>My team and I created a manual prototype with a stuffed pet animal to simulate a real dog. We then gave the
            users different tasks to perform in order to take care of the dog. Some of these tasks included things like
            cleaning up fake dog poop, identifying which kind of shampoo to use for their dog, and how to properly bathe
            the dog. What makes the tasks difficult is that in half of the tests, users were not given supplemental
            information to help them complete the tasks.</p>

        <h3>Insights</h3>
        <p>Users who did not have information to complete the tasks were far less detailed and cut corners altogether.
            Even though they cut corners, users who did not have instructions expressed higher levels of enjoyment.
            Another key insight was that users who did have the information followed the directions directly without
            skipping anything.
            Finally, users who struggled the most were individuals who have had little experience with pets.</p>

        <h3>Ideation</h3>
        <p>Create an application that can allow for users to find general information to solve an issue they are having,
            as well as a forum for specific questions that fall outside of the general information.</p>
